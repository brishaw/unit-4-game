## What is this repo or project?
Crystal Collector Game

## How does it work?
1. The program generates a random number between 19 - 120.
2. 4 crystal images will each have a random number assigned between 1 - 12 . 
3. The player does not know the value of the crystal until it has been clicked.
4. The player must try to match the generated random number [target number] by clicking on the 4 crystals.
5. If the player's accumulated total goes above the target number, the player loses and the game restarts showing a loss. 
6. If the player's accumulated total matches the target number, the player wins and the game restarts showing a win.
